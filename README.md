# Gift of Games Picker for Reddit

An utility that picks a winner of [r/GiftofGames](https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames) drawing in accordance with subreddit [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/wiki/rules). The latest release is sluggish but works more often than not. I'm going to convert the script to a bot and use cache to improve it's execution time. The script uses Python's standard [RNG](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) but I might decide on implementing a [random.org](https://www.random.org/) API.

The GoG Picker works with Steam giveaways only.

# Usage

The GoG Picker requires Python 3.6+ installed on your PC. You need a Steam and Reddit API keys. Check [a configuration section](#configuration) for more details. The script is intended to be invoked from a [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface):

```
$ python picker.py URL
```

The `URL` is a link to a r/GiftofGames thread like this one: `https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/7rq8fv/offersteam_humble_indie_bundle_3/`.

You can get some more help by invoking the script with an `-h` flag.

# Covered rules

The GoG Picker covers only a small subset of the subreddit rules, but large enough to pick a winner and save you some tedious work.

* a clickable Steam profile link was provided
* the link leads to an existing profile
* the profile is public
* the profile is level 2 or above
* a Redditor has 300 comment karma or more

# Configuration

GoG picker comes with two configuration files: `praw.ini.dist` and `settings.ini.dist`. You have to remove a `.dist` extension first.

## praw.ini

Used by [Python Reddit API Wrapper](https://github.com/praw-dev/praw) and documented [here](http://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/configuration/prawini.html). You need to request an API key from [here](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/) first.

## settings.ini

This file is used both by the GoG Picker and [Steam API wrapper](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/steam). It is divided into two sections: `[rules]` and `[steam]`.

### [rules]

Rules applicable to an user who wants to participate in a drawing.
